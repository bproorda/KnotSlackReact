# KnotSlack
Welcome to my Slack Clone!
This is a Chat application created using React.js on the front end, an Asp.net Core back end with Entity Framework. The real time chat is powered by Signalr.
It allows for messages to be sent to everyone, a specific group, or a specific user in real-time.

Any Comments/Advice would be appreciated!

## What is SignalR?
[Introduction to SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction?view=aspnetcore-3.1)
SignalR is a library for adding real time functionality to applications using web sockets. For those who are unfamiliar, a usual HTTP connection is only one way. The client sends a request to the server and the server responds. A web socket allows for two way communication. In SignalR, the client can call hub(on the server) methods, and the hub can call client methods.
